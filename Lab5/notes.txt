CS1023 Thursday Feb 3

This will be their first time writing any C code and the development 
environment (lcc) is a bit tricky.  I encourage you to set up lcc-win32 on 
your own machine and try it out thoroughly before Thursday.  The compiler 
is freely available here 

http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32

The library that comes with the text book has been compiled for Windows 
and is available on Blackboard-Student View-Library files.  The .h files 
all need to be downloaded and stored in the lcc\include directory.  
cslib.lib needs to be downloaded and stored in the lcc\lib directory.  

Everything is already set up in the labs.  The students just need to be 
sure to link the cslib.lib file (Project-Configuration-Linker) when they 
use any of the author's libraries.  Come and see me if you have any 
troubles with this.  

This lab may be really hard for them if we get a snow day on Wednesday so 
you will have to be patient and ready to do lots of explaining - they 
won't have heard about integer division.  If it doesn't snow on Wednesday 
I will introduce the ideas in class ahead of time.
