Recursion is similar to stepwise refinement in that both
strategies consist of breasking a problem down into simpler
problems that are easier to solve.  The distinguishing
characteristic of recursion is that the simpler subproblems
must have the same form as the original.


To use recursion you must be able to identify simple cases
for which the answer is easily determined and a recursive
decomposition that allows you to break any complex instance
of the problem into simpler problems of the same type.

Recursive functions are implemented using exactly the same
mechanism as any other function call.  Each call creates a new
stack frame that contains the local variables for that call.
Because the computer creates a separate stack frame for each
function call, the local variables at each level of recursive
decomposition remain separate.
